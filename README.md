# Aquari Base Integration
Given the speeds and compliance of base - and the commitment of aquari to always be at the forefront of doing the right things and making - saving the planet a simple work - we are moving to base - to more faciliatate our userbase with simplier tools in the ecosystem.

## Introduction
This repo is a collection of frontend, backend and our smart contraacts - as we grow we plan to branch them out into different repos. We are using Solidity for SC, ReactJS for frontend, expressJS for backend.

We welcome everyone in our community for feedbacks - that is how we believe is the only way forward.
